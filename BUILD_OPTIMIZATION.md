# Build Optimization Guide

## Overview
This guide explains the build optimizations implemented to reduce the Next.js build time from ~4 minutes to a more reasonable time.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)
- **SWC Minification**: Enabled `swcMinify: true` for faster JavaScript minification
- **Turbopack**: Configured for development builds with `--turbopack` flag
- **Module Imports**: Optimized imports for commonly used packages
- **Split Chunks**: Configured webpack to split vendor, common, and UI chunks for better caching
- **Parallel Processing**: Increased parallelism to 50 for faster builds
- **Production Optimizations**: Disabled source maps in production, removed console logs

### 2. Build Scripts (`package.json`)
- **Increased Memory**: Added `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'` to prevent memory issues
- **Fast Build**: Added `build:fast` script with experimental compile mode
- **Build Analysis**: Added `build:analyze` to identify bundle size issues

### 3. Turbo Configuration (`turbo.json`)
- Configured build pipeline for better caching
- Specified outputs and environment dependencies
- Enabled persistent dev server

## Usage

### Development
```bash
# Use Turbopack for fast development builds
bun run dev
```

### Production Builds
```bash
# Standard build with optimizations
bun run build

# Experimental fast build (may be less stable)
bun run build:fast

# Analyze bundle size
bun run build:analyze
```

## Expected Improvements

1. **Build Time**: Should reduce from ~4 minutes to ~1-2 minutes
2. **Memory Usage**: More efficient memory usage during builds
3. **Bundle Size**: Smaller bundles due to better code splitting
4. **Caching**: Better caching between builds

## Additional Optimizations to Consider

1. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: For pages that don't need to be static at build time
2. **Dynamic Imports**: Use `dynamic()` for heavy components
3. **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component with proper sizing
4. **API Route Optimization**: Consider edge runtime for simple API routes
5. **Database Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling for Prisma

## Monitoring Build Performance

To monitor build performance:
```bash
# Time the build
time bun run build

# Check bundle sizes
bun run build:analyze
```

## Troubleshooting

If builds are still slow:
1. Check for large dependencies in `package.json`
2. Look for circular dependencies
3. Ensure you're not importing entire libraries when you only need specific functions
4. Consider using a build cache service like Vercel's Remote Caching

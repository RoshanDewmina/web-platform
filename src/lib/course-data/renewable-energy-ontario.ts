- Aims to Limit global warming below 2¬∞C above pre-industrial levels
- Calls for urgent reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

## Canadian Context:
- The Government of Canada has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 through the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act and 2030 Emissions Reductions Plan
- As per the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan roadmap, it will reduce emissions by 40-45% from 2005 level by 2030
- Through the plan, Canada is taking a sector-by-sector approach, with a strong focus on the building and electricity sectors

## How to get started:
- Conduct a community energy survey
- Review current energy usage (Electricity bills)
- Engage elders, youth and leadership
- Create a vision statement
- Survey/Quiz ‚Äì Top priorities, energy challenges

## What is CEP and why does a community need it?
- A strategic roadmap for a community's energy future
- Identifies current energy use, community priorities, and clean energy opportunities
- Helps attract funding, partnerships, and guide long-term decision-making

## What is a Net-Zero Plan (NZP)?
- A plan to reduce or offset all greenhouse gas emissions from electricity use
- Sets clear timelines and strategies (e.g., "Net-zero electricity by 2030")
- Includes renewables, storage, efficiency, and fuel switching

## Why Does a Community Need These Plans?
- Aligns energy projects with local values, needs, and economic goals
- Builds a clear case for investment and funding
- Enables self-determination and reduces energy vulnerability
- Supports participation in broader initiatives like the IEX SuperGrid

## Benefits of CEP & NZP:
- Identify growing energy demand from homes, new housing, or infrastructure
- Explore sustainable options like solar, batteries, and efficiency retrofits
- Unlock economic opportunities like local jobs, training, and revenue from clean energy
- Guide project planning and attract funding
- Engage community members in shaping energy decisions

## Financial Metrics

### Simple Payback
- Total cost √∑ Annual savings
- Typically 7-12 years
- Doesn't consider financing

### Net Present Value (NPV)
- Present value of cash flows
- Considers time value of money
- Positive NPV = good investment

### Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)
- Total lifecycle cost √∑ Total energy
- Compare to utility rates
- Lower = better

              title: "Calculating Payback & IRR",
              content: `
## Financial Analysis Tools

### Payback Calculation
1. Annual energy production (kWh)
2. Energy value ($/kWh)
3. Annual revenue/savings
4. Operating costs
5. Net annual benefit
6. Payback = Cost √∑ Benefit

### IRR Calculation
- Use 20-25 year analysis
- Include all cash flows
- Consider incentives
- Account for degradation
- Target IRR: 8-15%

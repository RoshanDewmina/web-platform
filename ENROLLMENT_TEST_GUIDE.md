# Enrollment Test Guide

Follow these steps to test the enrollment flow:

## Step 1: Ensure Dev Server is Running
Make sure your development server is running on http://localhost:3001

## Step 2: Sync Your User Account

### Option A: Direct Sync (Recommended)
1. Visit: http://localhost:3001/sync-user
2. You should see:
   - A loading spinner saying "Syncing your account..."
   - Then a green checkmark with "User synced successfully! Redirecting..."
   - Automatic redirect to dashboard after 1.5 seconds

### Option B: Auto-Sync via Dashboard
1. Visit: http://localhost:3001/dashboard
2. If you see a popup asking to sync, click OK
3. You'll be redirected to the sync page

## Step 3: Verify User Sync
After syncing, you can verify your user exists by checking the console in the browser DevTools:
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Look for messages like "User synced successfully"

## Step 4: Test Enrollment
1. Go to: http://localhost:3001/learn
2. Find the course "Modern Web Development with Next.js"
3. Click "Enroll Now"
4. You should:
   - See no error message
   - Be redirected to the course page
   - The button should change to "Continue Learning"

## Step 5: Verify Enrollment
1. Go back to: http://localhost:3001/learn
2. Click on "My Courses" tab
3. You should see the enrolled course there

## Troubleshooting

### If sync fails:
1. Make sure you're logged in through Clerk
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try signing out and back in

### If enrollment still fails:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. The error message should now be more descriptive

### To manually check your user in database:
Run this command in terminal:
```bash
node scripts/list-users.js
```

You should see your email listed.

## Expected Flow
1. First visit â†’ User not in database
2. Sync page â†’ Creates user in database
3. Enrollment â†’ Works successfully
4. Future visits â†’ No sync needed

Happy testing! ðŸš€
